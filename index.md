Reflections: I was inspired by the idea of mood jewellery and combining emotional states through visible and trackable. Most wearables focus on fitness, but I wanted something that supports reflection and mental wellbeing. The idea of using heart rate as a proxy for mood felt intuitive, especially for detecting stress spikes.
